# SkiaSharp Workbook

Welcome to SkiaSharp, the most awesome, cross-platform 2D-graphics engine. It is powered by the same engine that powers Android and Chrome.

After installing the `SkiaSharp` NuGet package, we must make sure that the references have been added:

```csharp
#r "SkiaSharp"
```

That being done, we can now add the typical `using` statements:

```csharp
using SkiaSharp;
```

Now, we can start coding. Here we create a simple 256x256 canvas:

```csharp
// create the bitmap that will hold the pixels
var bitmap = new SKBitmap(256, 256);

// create the canvas so that we can draw on thet bitmap
var canvas = new SKCanvas(bitmap);

// clear the canvas, so that it is fresh
canvas.Clear(SKColors.Transparent);

// appear in Workbooks
bitmap
```

Before we can draw anything, we need to create the object that will be used to describe how the thing we are drawing will look. To do this, we need a `SKPaint` object:

```csharp
var paint = new SKPaint {
    IsAntialias = true,                               // smooth text
    TextSize = 50,                                    // 50px high text
    TextAlign = SKTextAlign.Center,                   // center the text
    Color = 0xFF3498DB,                               // Xamarin light blue text
    Style = SKPaintStyle.Fill,                        // solid text
    Typeface = SKTypeface.FromFamilyName("Trebuchet") // use the Trebuchet typeface
};
```

Now that our canvas is all ready, we can start drawing. Here we are writing the word “SkiaSharp” in the middle:

```csharp
// clear the canvas, just in case we are running this a second time
canvas.Clear(SKColors.Transparent);

// draw the text using the paint
canvas.DrawText("SkiaSharp", 128, 128 + (paint.TextSize / 2), paint);

// appear in Workbooks
bitmap
```

That’s it! So simple! And, best of all, this code can be used ANYWHERE!
